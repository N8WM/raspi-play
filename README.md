## Materials
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W - [Amazon](https://a.co/d/fDa0be4) | [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5291)
- I2S PCM5102A DAC Decoder - [Amazon](https://a.co/d/4PBEBoA) | [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313&_nkw=QCCAN+Interface+I2S+PCM5102A+DAC+Decoder+GY-PCM5102+I2S+Player+Module+pHAT+Format+Board+Digital+PCM5102+Audio+Board+for+Raspberry+Pi&_sacat=0)
- MicroSD Card (8GB+) - [Amazon](https://a.co/d/fdQJwdG) | [Western Digital](www.westerndigital.com/products/memory-cards/sandisk-ultra-uhs-i-microsd)

## Tools
- 3D Printer
- Soldering Iron
- Solder (preferably rosin core, lead-free)
- Jumper wires (if your DAC decoder does not come with them, mine did)
- Third hand tool/PCB holder (optional but recommended)
- Hot glue & glue gun
- Metal file (or something else to shave down HDMI overhang)

## Instructions
